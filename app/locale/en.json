They say they've found edible plants on the surface. They've classified and evaluated them, and marked their positions on a map.</p><p>A lot of people don't believe the stories. \"Edible plants? There never ain't no such thing!\" they say. In reply, one Veganaut got a \"Bye bye Space Gunk\" tattoo.
